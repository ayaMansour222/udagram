 UDAGRAM is a full stack application that we  deployed  to Amazon cloud service  so that it is available to customers. This application contains the main components of a 3-tier full stack application (UI, API, and Database).

we followed  the following steps:

1- Configure the services and infrastructure on AWS services (RDS, S3 and elastic beanstalk).
2- Create scripts to deploy each component of the application.
3- Create and document an automated pipeline using CircleCI.
